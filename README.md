Welcome to my personal portfolio — a fully custom, responsive website built to reflect not only my technical skillset but also my design philosophy. From layout to logic, every part of this project has been crafted by me, with thoughtful use of modern web tools and a clean visual identity rooted in consistency, minimalism, and user friendliness.

This portfolio serves as an interactive snapshot of who I am as a developer and designer. It highlights my journey, the projects I’ve worked on, and the professional experiences that have shaped me. Built using core web technologies and templating tools, it emphasizes clarity, usability, and aesthetics — all stitched together with performance in mind.

## 🎨 Design System

A balanced and expressive palette guides the visual tone of the site:

| Color Name        | Hex Code  | Usage                                 |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| 🌞 Warm Yellow   | `#FAAD1B` | Emphasis, CTA buttons, highlights     |
| 🌲 Deep Green    | `#344C36` | Headers, accents, strong grounding    |
| ☁️ Soft White    | `#F5F7FA` | Backgrounds, content blocks, contrast |

Animations, spacing, and transitions were curated with user attention and readability in mind. The ui theme create a modern, sleek feel that complements the project galleries and typography.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project deepened my knowledge in:

- Crafting modular views with EJS and Express routing
- Using jQuery UI to add intuitive, user-friendly transitions
- Designing responsive layouts from scratch without frameworks
- Managing assets, routing, and build structure in a clean, scalable way
- Thinking like a front-end designer and a back-end developer simultaneously
- Collaborating with AI tools as co-creators during the build process

Beyond the technical, this journey strengthened my ability to stay committed to a vision, evolve design choices iteratively, and polish a project to a professional finish.
